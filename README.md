#### **Handling configuration changes while adding, removing and replacing fragments**

## **When configuration change can happen?**

Changing screen orientation, user enabling multi window, user making keyboard available, or anything that can delay app 
usage might cause configuration changes. When configuration changes, the *system destroys the fragment and activity and 
restarts by executing on create*. As developers, we have to make sure that our application wonâ€™t lose user's data after 
configuration changes. And to restore all users previous state we need to handle this configuration changes, and at the 
same time, we don't want a slow user experience while restoring data.
